            <p>I was born in Denver, CO and lived there until I moved to Loveland, CO when I was 10.  I have a BS in Electrical &amp; Computer Engineering from the University of Colorado at Boulder (GO BUFFS!).  After college I moved to New York City and worked in Hospitality for two years.  Once I got the big city life out of my system I moved back to Colorado to continue my career.  I've gaoined experience in Technical Support, Engineering Sales, and Small Business managment.  I decided that I wanted a more focused and fullfulling career and am persuing a career in Web Development.</p>
            <p>My hobbies are everything Soccer and Golf.  I am a die hard Manchester United supporter (GLORY GLORY MAN UNITED!) and my favorite golfer is Rory McIlroy (mostly because he is also a Manchester United supporter).</p>
